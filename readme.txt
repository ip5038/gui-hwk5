This website is a simple game of scrabble. Drag and drop letters from the rack 
to create words. You will see the word and score on the top as you add letters. 
The word does NOT need to exist in the dictionary. Below are a list of feature:

* Drag and drop tiles from rack to board and vice versa
        * You cannot drop letters back on rack from the middle of a word. This is to prevent
            holes in the word

* The blue boxes give double the points
* Letters are randomly chosen and as you use each letter, its count reduces by 1
* User can restart any time and that will give all tiles back.
    * This will reset score, but keep the highest score

* Use can only place letters next to eachother. First letter can be place anywhere, but the remaining 
letters must be subsequent.
* Tiles bounce back if not placed in appropriate location (ie. the rack or board)
